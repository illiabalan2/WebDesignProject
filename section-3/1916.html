                    <p>The 1916 Easter Rising was a pivotal event in Irish history, where Irish republicans launched an armed rebellion against British rule in Dublin. 
                        Led by the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, the rebels seized key locations in the city, declaring an Irish Republic. 
                        Though the uprising was suppressed within a week, it marked a turning point, 
                        galvanizing public support for Irish independence and leading to the eventual establishment of the Irish Free State.

<figcaption>The Easter Rising took place against a backdrop of increased political tension. 
    This was caused by British reluctance to implement Home Rule - enacted by the 1914 Government of Ireland Act - 
    and their assertion that it could only be done if military conscription was also introduced to Ireland.
    This linking of conscription and Home Rule outraged Irish nationalists of all persuasions. 
    But the militant Irish Republican Brotherhood, 
    along with sections of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army, opted for a violent response</figcaption>

<figcaption><words>The revolt came as a shock to the British, who believed the rebellion plot had been postponed
    after their recent interception of German weapons. After days of bloody fighting, on the 29th of April, the 16 leaders
    of the revolt were arrested and brought to Kilmainham Jail. Overall, 120 British soldiers, along with 60 men from
    the Volunteers and Irish Citizens army were killed over the course of the Rising.Over 180 civilians also died.<words></figcaption>

<figcaption>Initially, the Irish public was critical of the 1916 Easter Rising, viewing it as a reckless and violent uprising that disrupted daily life and caused widespread destruction in Dublin. Many felt the rebellion was premature, especially since it was poorly planned and quickly suppressed. However, public opinion shifted dramatically after the British government executed the leaders of the rising. These executions sparked outrage and sympathy for the rebels, transforming them into martyrs for the cause of Irish independence. As a result, support for the nationalist movement grew, ultimately leading to greater public backing for the struggle against British rule.</figcaption>
