                        <p>The Celts arrived in Britain and Ireland around 500BC and within a few hundred years, Ireland's Bronze Age culture had all but disappeared, 
                        and Celtic culture was in place across the entire island. 
                        The specifics of this migration remain shrouded in mystery, as reliable information on how and when the Celts asserted themselves as the 
                        dominant ethnic group in Ireland is scarce.

                    Religion  -  The Celtic religion was polytheistic, meaning they had more than one god. In fact, the Celtic religion is thought to have over 300 gods. The Celts would sacrifice animals to their gods, and they believed in an afterlife, as they were often buried with their possessions, so they could take them into the next life.
                    The Celtic religion was led by Druids, who were learned healers who took the role of cultural leaders for Celtic tribes. 
                    The Druids kept no written records, so little is known about their religion.

                            Food - The Celts kept domesticated cows, pigs, and sheep. 
                            Cattle, of course, was the basis of the ancient Irish economy, so beef topped the list of desirable meats. 
                            Pork was also prized. 
                            Since the early sheep were smaller and goat-like, they were valued more for wool and milk than for meat. 
                            Besides this domestic threesome, some hunter might bring down a deer, a game bird, or catch a fish.
                            The Celts also ate various berries, nuts and oats, either raw or as ingredients for other meals - such as porridge.

                            Festivals - Among other things, Celts are renowned for the festivals they threw during the year, such as Beltine (1 May),
                            Imbolc (1 February) and Lughnasadh (1 August). These dates would be marked with feasts and celebration. Most notable
                            of these was Samhain, (1 November) as it was seen as the start if the new year in the Celtic calendar. It was also seen
                            as a transitory period, where spirits of the dead could communicate with the living for one night. This festival
                            is the origin for what we now know as Halloween.
